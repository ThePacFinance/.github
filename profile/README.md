## Packing the Real-World Assets

To sustain a self-sufficient on-chain economy, real world yields need to be accessed with efficiency, selection, and mostly importantly, security. On the flip side, finance is about bridging liquidity; itâ€™s about the speed of money, the ease of access, and security. Tokenization hits all targets, and we believe in this finality-the endgame of finance is on-chain, while the mass adoption future requires real world yields.

thePAC in paving the way to build upon the rare strength of a real-world asset management giant with an ecosystem of tokens which will be seamlessly integrated with payment, money market, lending, yield farming - every corner of the decentralized world.
